structure. It will return a pointer to the phylib_object. If the malloc function fails, it will
return NULL (before trying to store the function parameters in the (non-existent) structure)*/

/*This function will allocate memory for a table structure, returning NULL if the memory
allocation fails. The member variable, time, will be set to 0.0. It will then assign the values of
its array elements to pointers to new objects created by the phylib_new_* functions provided
above. Specifically, it will add elements in this order:
1) a horizontal cushion at y=0.0;
2) a horizontal cushion at y=PHYLIB_TABLE_LENGTH;
3) a vertical cushion at x=0.0;
4) a vertical cushion at x=PHYLIB_TABLE_WIDTH;
5) 6 holes: positioned in the four corners where the cushions meet and two more
midway between the top holes and bottom holes.
The remaining pointers will all be set to NULL.*/

void phylib_copy_object( phylib_object **dest, phylib_object **src );

/*This function should allocate new memory for a phylib_object. Save the address of that
object at the location pointed to by dest, and copy over the contents of the object from the
location pointed to by src. Hint, you can use memcpy to make this a one-step operation that
works for any type of phylib_object. If src points to a location containing a NULL pointer,
then the location pointed to by dest should be assigned the value of NULL.*/

phylib_table *phylib_copy_table( phylib_table *table );

/*This function should allocate memory for a new phylib_table, returning NULL if the malloc
fails. Then the contents pointed to by table should be copied to the new memory location and
the address returned.*/

void phylib_add_object( phylib_table *table, phylib_object *object );

/*This function should iterate over the object array in the table until it finds a NULL pointer. It
should then assign that pointer to be equal to the address of object. If there are no NULL
pointers in the array, the function should do nothing.*/

also free table as well.*/

/*This function should return the difference between c1 and c2. That is the result’s x value
should be c1.x-c2.x and similarly for y.*/

double phylib_length( phylib_coord c );

/*This function should return the length of the vector/coordinate c. You can calculate this length
by using Pythagorean theorem. Important, you must not use the exp function from the math
library. That function is designed for raising values to a real power and is extremely inefficient
for something as simple as squaring a value.*/

double phylib_dot_product( phylib_coord a, phylib_coord b );

/*This function should compute the dot-product between two vectors. Hint: the dot product is
equal to the sum of: the product of the x-values and the product of the y-values.*/

double phylib_distance( phylib_object *obj1, phylib_object *obj2 );

/*This function should calculate the distance between two objects, obj1 and obj2. obj1 must be
a PHYLIB_ROLLING_BALL; if it is not the function should return -1.0. Otherwise ,the distance
between the obj1 (PHYLIB_ROLLING_BALL) and obj2 is given by the following rules:
1) If obj2 is another BALL ( ROLLING or STILL), then compute the distance between the
centres of the two balls and subtract two radii (i.e. one PHYLIB_BALL_DIAMETER).
2) If obj2 is a HOLE, then compute the distance between the centre of the ball and the
hole and subtract the HOLE_RADIUS.
3) If obj2 is a CUSHION calculate the distance between the centre of the ball and the
CUSION and subtract the BALL_RADIUS. Hint: use abs since the ball might be left/above
or right/below to CUSHION.
Return -1.0 if obj2 isn’t any valid type.*/

//These functions simulate the balls moving on the table.

void phylib_roll( phylib_object *new, phylib_object *old, double time );

/*This function updates a new phylib_object that represents the old phylib_object after it
has rolled for a period of time. If new and old are not PHYLIB_ROLLING_BALLs, then the
function should do nothing. Otherwise, it should update the values in new. Specifically the
position, and velocities should be updated as follows:

p=p1+v1t+0.5a1t^2

(For physics/math fans, this is the second integral of the acceleration.) Here, the variable
represents either the x or y position of the ball, the variable represents either the x or y
velocity of the ball, and represents either the x or y acceleration of the ball. The subscript 1
indicates we are talking about the old ball. The velocity of the new ball (in either the x or y
dimension) is given by:

v=v1+a1t

One additional constraint must be observed. If either velocity changes sign, then that velocity
and its corresponding acceleration ( x, or y) must be set to zero (if both velocities change sign,
then both velocities and both accelerations must be set to zero).*/
unsigned char phylib_stopped( phylib_object *object );
/*This function will check whether a ROLLING_BALL has stopped, and if it has, will convert it to a
STILL_BALL. You may assume that object is a ROLLING_BALL. The function will return 1 if it
converts the ball, 0 if it does not.
For the purposes of this simulation a ball is considered to have stopped if its speed (which is the
length of its velocity) is less than PHYLIB_VEL_EPSILON.
Do not assume that the number, and x and y positions of the rolling ball will be automatically
transferred to the still ball.*/
void phylib_bounce( phylib_object **a, phylib_object **b );

/*This is the most complicated function in the assignment but it can be handled by divide and
conquer based on the type of object b. You may assume that object a is a ROLLING_BALL.
Note that the two arguments to this function are double pointers. That is, they are pointers to
pointers to phylib_objectss.
CASE 1: b is a HCUSHION:
In this case the y velocity and y acceleration of a are reversed (negated). This is the
physical principle of angle of incidence equals angle of reflection.
CASE 2: b is a VCUSION:
In this case the x velocity and x acceleration of a are reversed (negated). This is the
physical principle of angle of incidence equals angle of reflection.
CASE 3: b is a HOLE:
In this case, free the memory of a and set it to NULL. This represents the ball falling off
the table.
CASE 4: b is a STILL_BALL:
In this case, “upgrade” the STILL_BALL to a ROLLING BALL and proceed directly to CASE
5 (do not collect $200). HINT: if you leave out the break statement at the end of a case
condition, the code will continue with the next case.
CASE 5: b is a ROLLING_BALL:
This one is a little bit tricky and will require us to calculate a few intermediate values
before we can know the speeds and directions of the two balls after they collide.
Compute the position of a with respect to b: subtract the position of b from a; call it
r_ab.
Compute the relative velocity of a with respect to b: subtract the velocity of a from b;
call it v_rel.
Divide the x and y components of r_ab by the length of r_ab; call that a normal
vector, n.
Calculate the ratio of the relative velocity, v_rel, in the direction of ball a by computing
the dot_product of v_rel with respect to n; call that v_rel_n.
Now, ball a will roll perpendicular to the direction from a to b, and b will run in the
direction from a to b.
Update the x velocity of ball a by subtracting v_rel_n multipied by the x component of
vector n. Similarly, Update the x velocity of ball a by subtracting v_rel_n multipied by
the x component of vector n.
Update the x and y velocities of ball b by adding the product of v_rel_n and vector n.
Compute the speed of a and b as the lengths of their velocities. If the speed is greater
than PHYLIB_VEL_EPSILON then set the acceleration of the ball to the negative
velocity divided by the speed multiplied by PHYLIB_DRAG.*/


unsigned char phylib_rolling( phylib_table *t );
/*This function returns the number of rolling balls on the table*/

phylib_table *phylib_segment( phylib_table *table );
/*This function should return a segment of a pool shot, as follows.
If there are no ROLLING_BALLs on the table, it should return NULL.
Otherwise, it should return a phylib_copy_table. The returned table should be the result of
applying the phylib_roll function to each ROLLING_BALL with a value of time that starts at
PHYLIB_SIM_RATE and increments by PHYLIB_SIM_RATE. All the balls should roll at the same
time, so make sure to put the loop over the OBJECTS inside the loop over the time. The loop
over the time should end if:
1) PHYLIB_MAX_TIME is reached,
2) The phylib_distance between the ball and another phylib_object is less than 0.0.
If this happens, apply the phylib_bounce function to the ball and the object before
returning the copy of the table.
3) A ROLLING_BALL has stopped.*/
